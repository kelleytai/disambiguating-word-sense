# disambiguating-word-sense

With NLTK, and using WordNet as a dictionary, I wrote a program that uses the Lesk algorithm to disambiguate the part-of-speechâ€“tagged words in a sentence.

This project was part of the University of Toronto's Computational Linguistics course. 

There is only file in this repository: leskoutput.txt

Please e-mail me if you would like to review the whole code base. 

leskoutput.txt is the output file when you run my lesk.py (not provided) .

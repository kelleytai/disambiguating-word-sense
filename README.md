# disambiguating-word-sense

With NLTK, and using WordNet as a dictionary, I wrote a program that uses the Lesk algorithm to disambiguate the part-of-speechâ€“tagged words in a sentence.

This project was part of the University of Toronto's Computational Linguistics course. 

There are two files in this projects: 
1. lesk.py
2. leskoutput.txt

lesk.py includes only part of the code for the Lesk algorithm. Please e-mail me if you would like to review the whole code base. 

leskoutput.txt includes the output file when you run lesk.py. 

To run lesk.py, you need NLTK. Download the latest version of NLTK.

salad/N
salad#1
salad#1    food mixtures either arranged on a plate or tossed and served
           with a moist dressing; usually consisting of or including greens 
           2    ['food', 'served']
I will have to agree with the system's output because there is only definition
for salad. 

greens/N
greens#1 
greens#1    any of various leafy plants or their leaves and stems eaten as
            vegetables    2     ['various', 'eaten']
greens#2    green color or pigment; resembling the color of growing grass
            1     ['green']
greens#3    a piece of open land for recreational use in an urban area    1
            ['area']
greens#4    United States labor leader who was president of the American
            Federation of Labor from 1924 to 1952 and who led the struggle
            with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (1873-1952)    1    
            ['American']
greens#5    an environmentalist who belongs to the Green Party    0     []
greens#6    a river that rises in western Wyoming and flows southward through 
            Utah to become a tributary of the Colorado River    0     []
greens#7    an area of closely cropped grass surrounding the hole on a 
            golf course    1     ['area']
greens#8    any of various leafy plants or their leaves and stems eaten as
            vegetables    2     ['various', 'eaten']
greens#9    street names for ketamine    0     []
I agree with the system's output. In the context of the given sentence,
greens means vegetables that can be eaten. The only sense that can make
sense is greens#1 (hahaha see what I did there).

tomato/N
tomato#1
tomato#1    mildly acid red or yellow pulpy fruit eaten as a vegetable    3
            ['pulpy', 'fruit', 'eaten']
tomato#2    native to South America; widely cultivated in many varieties    0
            [] 
I agree with the system's output. In the context of the sentence, tomato most
likely means a red fruit that is somewhat acidic and can be "eaten as a vegetable". 
Tomato#2 could make sense but it is hard to tell whether or the tomato in the
sentence was native to South America or not. 

addition/N
addition#2 
addition#1    a component that is added to something to improve it    1 
              ['added']
addition#2    the act of adding one thing to another    2     ['one', 'thing']
addition#3    a quantity that is added    1     ['added']
addition#4    something added to what you already have    1     
              ['added']
addition#5    a suburban area laid out in streets and lots for a future 
              residential area    1     ['area']
addition#6    the arithmetic operation of summing; calculating the sum of two
              or more numbers    0     []
I disagree with the system's output. Since the sentence is saying that eating a
salad with greens and tomato is a nice bonus to a meal, I would agree with
addition #1. It seems that eating a salad with greens and tomato can brighten up
one's day or improve the quality of one's meal. 

meal/N
meal#1 
meal#1    the food served and eaten at one time    4     ['food', 'served',
          'eaten', 'one']
meal#2    any of the occasions for eating food that occur by custom or habit
          at more or less fixed times    1     ['food']
meal#3    coarsely ground foodstuff; especially seeds of various cereal 
          grasses or pulse    1     ['various']
I agree with the chosen prediction. In this case, the sentence says that a
salad with greens and tomato can be food that is served and eaten. 

avocado/N
avocado#2 
avocado#1    a pear-shaped tropical fruit with green or blackish skin and
             rich yellowish pulp enclosing a single large seed    2     
             ['fruit', 'green']
avocado#2    tropical American tree bearing large pulpy green fruits    3
             ['American', 'pulpy', 'green']
I disagree with the program's prediction. The sentence implies that avocado is
something that can be eaten. avocado#2 is a tree. We do not eat trees (at least,
not in a salad with greens and tomatoes). When we talk about avocados, it 
usually pertains to the fruit. 

special/Adj
special#1 
special#1    unique or specific to a person or thing or category    1     
             ['thing']
special#2    for a special service or occasion    0     []
special#3    surpassing what is common or usual or expected    0     []
special#4    adapted to or reserved for a particular purpose    0     []
special#5    having a specific function or scope    0     []
special#6    first and most important    0     []
special#7    added to a regular schedule    1     ['added']
I disagree with the system's output. The correct sense should be special#3.
Adding an avocado to a salad with greens and tomatoes will make the meal
taste better. The meal is not ordinary, but better. This context suits the
third sense the most.
